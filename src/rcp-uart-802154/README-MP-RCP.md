# Multiprotocol (OpenThread+Zigbee) RCP

This multiprotocol radio co-processor (RCP) application supports running OpenThread and Zigbee stacks simultaneously on a host processor. It uses concurrent multiprotocol (CMP) / multi-PAN functionality to run the 802.15.4 networks simultaneously on the same channel.

The host stacks and the RCP communicate using the Co-Processor Communication protocol (CPC), which acts as a protocol multiplexer and serial transport layer. The host applications connect to the CPC daemon, which in turn connects to the EFR via a SPI or UART link.

Refer to *AN1333: Running Zigbee, OpenThread, and Bluetooth Concurrently on a Linux Host with a Multiprotocol Co-processor* for more information on running the multiprotocol RCP with different host applications.
